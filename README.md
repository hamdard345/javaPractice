# Abstract Car Example
+ This project is a simple example of using abstract classes and inheritance in Java. It demonstrates how to create an abstract class Car and two subclasses SportsCar and SUV that extend it.

# Classes
+ Car: This is an abstract class that contains two abstract methods accelerate() and brake(), and a regular method honk(). It also has two protected variables brand and model.
+ SportsCar: This is a subclass that inherits from Car and provides its own implementation for the abstract methods. It also has a private variable topSpeed.
+ SUV: This is another subclass that inherits from Car and provides its own implementation for the abstract methods. It also has a private variable topSpeed.
